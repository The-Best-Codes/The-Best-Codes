- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @The-Best-Codes
- I love coding in web <p id="best-codes-langs" title="HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, etc.">languages</p> and some simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node.js</a>. I also do some micropython, bash, c++, etc. I do some stuff with Arduinos too. I am Best_codes pretty much everywhere.
- I have a dev.to, a Stack Overflow, a GitHub, and more.
- I do web dev and software dev and half moderate for the makeblock forum.
- You can contact me through best-codes@proton.me, my trash email (donâ€™t ever share your real one).

- I am working on a home and weather monitor called WeatherWorks.
- I am learing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and also how to <a href="https://www.printables.com/@Best_codes">3D design</a>. 
- I like developing extenions for mBlock (it is easy now that I have more experience), and programming simple projects with it.

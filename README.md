ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @The-Best-Codes

I love coding in <span title="HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, etc." id="best-codes-langs"><ins>web languages</ins></span> and some simple [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) languages like [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js). I also do some [Micropython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython), [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and other unrelated languages. I do some stuff with [Arduinos](https://www.arduino.cc/), too (particularly [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino_Uno)s). I am [Best_codes](https://www.google.com/search?q=best_codes) pretty much everywhere.

I have a [dev.to](https://dev.to/best_codes?referal=best_codes&myself), a <span title="I don't use it much. :/">[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/20392792/best-codes?ref=best-codes&id=github.com&purpose=profile-readme.md)</span>, a <span title="You are looking at it. :D">[GitHub](https://github.com/The-Best-Codes)</span>, and more.

I do web development (some [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/?ref=the-best-codes_github.com), but primarily [hand coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_coding) and software developement (mostly using <span title="Build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS">[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)</span>). I also half moderate for the [makeblock forum](https://forum.makeblock.com?invite=best_codes&ref=the-best-codes_github.com) (I am Best_codes on there).

I have developed a couple extensions, for my favorite browser, (and the best browser there is!) [Opera](https://opera.com?ref=best_codes).

You can contact me through best-codes@proton.me, my trash email (donâ€™t ever share your real one).

I am working on a home and weather monitor called WeatherWorks.

I am learning [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and also how to [3D design](https://www.printables.com/@Best_codes).

I like developing extensions for [mBlock](https://www.mblock.cc/en/?ref-url=the-best-codes__github.com__profile&id=readme.md) (it is easy now that I have more experience), and programming simple projects with it.

Enjoy my profile!
